# bamazon_sql
Bamazon is a shopping prototype CLI app that uses a SQL database to track orders, update inventories, and determines trending products



## Overview

The bamazon app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. Bamazon also tracks product sales across departments and generates reports of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

# Requirements

* Node.js
* MySQL
* Inquirer.js
* Chalk.js


## How it works

*  (screenshots/video) of typical user flows through the application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor).
*  Views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).
* Other functionality screenshots.
